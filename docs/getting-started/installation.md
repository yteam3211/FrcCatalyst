## Prerequisites

- **WPILib 2026** installed ([download](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html))
- A **GradleRIO robot project** (created via WPILib project generator)
- These vendordeps installed in your project (Catalyst builds on them):
  **CTRE Phoenix 6**, **PathPlanner**, and **PhotonVision**. Install them
  the usual way (Manage Vendor Libraries → Install new libraries online)
  with their official URLs.

## Option 1: Vendordep (Recommended)

The easiest install. In WPILib VS Code, open the command palette and run
**WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries → Install new libraries (online)**, then
paste:

```
https://tomas-1226.github.io/FrcCatalyst/vendordep/FrcCatalyst.json
```

That adds FrcCatalyst to your project and lets WPILib check for updates.
Make sure the Phoenix 6, PathPlanner, and PhotonVision vendordeps are also
installed (Catalyst depends on them).

## Option 2: JitPack (build.gradle)

If you'd rather add it by hand, put the JitPack repository and the
dependency in your robot project's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    // ... your existing repositories ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    // ... your existing dependencies ...
    implementation "com.github.TomAs-1226:FrcCatalyst:v1.0.0-rc2"
}
```

## Option 3: Local Maven (From Source)

If you prefer to build from source or need to modify the library:

```bash
# Clone FrcCatalyst
git clone https://github.com/TomAs-1226/FrcCatalyst.git
cd FrcCatalyst

# Publish to local Maven
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Then in your robot project's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.frccatalyst:FrcCatalyst:1.0.0-rc2"
}
```

## Verify Installation

Create a simple test in your `RobotContainer` to confirm everything is working:

```java
import frc.lib.catalyst.hardware.MotorType;
import frc.lib.catalyst.util.CatalystMath;

// In your RobotContainer constructor:
System.out.println("Kraken X60 free speed: "
    + MotorType.KRAKEN_X60.freeSpeedRPS() + " RPS");
System.out.println("Processed joystick: "
    + CatalystMath.processJoystick(0.5, 0.05, 2.0, 1.0));
```

If it compiles and prints the values, you're good to go!
