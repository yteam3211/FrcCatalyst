/**
 * A single, named <em>intent</em> the robot can pursue — "score high",
 * "intake from the ground", "aim and shoot". A {@code Goal} is the unit the
 * optional {@link GoalDirector} works with.
 *
 * <p>This is the "software-defined robot" layer: instead of the driver
 * commanding every mechanism by hand, they hand the robot an intent and the
 * director figures out the details — reach the right superstructure state,
 * run the setup work (spin a shooter, aim a turret), report when it's ready,
 * and hand control back the instant the driver wants it.
 *
 * <p><b>This whole package is optional.</b> Nothing else in Catalyst depends
 * on it. A goal composes pieces you already have:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@link frc.lib.catalyst.mechanisms.SuperstructureCoordinator}
 *       state to reach (optional), and/or</li>
 *   <li>arbitrary <em>setup</em> commands to run alongside the transition
 *       (optional) — e.g. spin a flywheel, track with a turret, auto-align
 *       the drivetrain, and/or</li>
 *   <li>a <em>readiness</em> test that decides when the goal is "good to go"
 *       (optional).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A goal with no superstructure state and no coordinator is perfectly
 * valid: it's just "run this setup command, with intent telemetry and driver
 * override for free." So teams that never touch the coordinator can still use
 * goals as a thin intent layer.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Goal SCORE_HIGH = Goal.named("ScoreHigh")
 *     .superstructureState("SCORE_HIGH")            // coordinator state to reach
 *     .with(() -> shooter.spinUp(4300))             // setup, runs alongside
 *     .readyWhen(() -> superstructure.isAtState("SCORE_HIGH")
 *                       && shooter.atSpeed())        // when is it good to fire?
 *     .build();
 *
 * Goal STOW = Goal.named("Stow").superstructureState("STOW").build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see GoalDirector
