/**
 * The optional "give the robot an intent, it figures out the details" layer.
 * A {@code GoalDirector} turns a {@link Goal} into a runnable command that
 * drives the superstructure to the right state, runs the goal's setup work,
 * reports readiness, and hands control back to the driver the moment they
 * want it.
 *
 * <p>This is the capstone that ties together pieces you already have
 * ({@link SuperstructureCoordinator}, mechanisms, {@code AimingSolver},
 * {@code RobotSafety}). It is deliberately thin and <b>completely optional</b>
 * — skip this package entirely and every other part of Catalyst is unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>Driver override is free</h2>
 * A pursued goal {@linkplain Command#getRequirements() requires} the same
 * subsystems its transition and setup touch (via the coordinator and your
 * setup command). So the instant the driver triggers anything that needs
 * those subsystems — including their default commands — WPILib interrupts the
 * goal. There is no special "abort" path to get wrong: it's the standard
 * command-requirement model. Bind a goal with {@code whileTrue} and releasing
 * the button ends it; bind with {@code onTrue} and it latches until something
 * else claims the subsystems.
 *
 * <h2>Telemetry</h2>
 * Everything publishes under {@code /Catalyst/Goal}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Active} — the goal currently being pursued (or the default)</li>
 *   <li>{@code TargetState} — the superstructure state it's driving toward</li>
 *   <li>{@code Ready} — is the active goal ready (per its readiness test)?</li>
 *   <li>{@code WhyNotReady} — a short reason when it isn't</li>
 * </ul>
 * so you can watch on the dashboard exactly what the robot thinks it's doing
 * and why it isn't ready yet.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * GoalDirector director = GoalDirector.builder()
 *     .coordinator(superstructure)   // optional
 *     .defaultGoal(STOW)             // safe fallback (optional)
 *     .build();
 *
 * // Hold to pursue, release to hand control back to the driver:
 * driver.y().whileTrue(director.pursue(SCORE_HIGH));
 * driver.a().whileTrue(director.pursue(INTAKE));
 *
 * // Buzz the driver when the active goal becomes ready to fire:
 * director.readyTrigger().onTrue(rumble.shortPulse());
 * }</pre>
